Developer Error Dashboard
JavaScript, HTML, Excel, Google Charts â€¢Fall 2020

For this undergraduate research project, I developed the infrastructure to track software errors by software developers and visually display the most common errors, as well as changes in error frequency and density over time.
Developed with a Virginia Tech Computer Science professor who I reported to weekly in order to simulate a project in the workplace.
Stock Pattern Analyzer
Java, AutoIt, Excel, Apache POI â€¢Summer 2020

Throughout summer of 2020, I fully developed a personal Java program that would aid me in my hobby of day trading by gathering the daily price action of a stock, analyzing it, and storing the results in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.
This program finds different patterns in stock price, takes in user information, and gathers general stock information, and in the end, it would store it all in a spreadsheet that could be used as a visual aid for when I am trading.
